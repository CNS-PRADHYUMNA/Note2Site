## Short AI Summary

Across Washington, New York, Paris, and Moscow, Bourne sets elaborate traps, decodes messages, and protects his loved ones while Carlos manipulates governments to turn them against him. The tension culminates in a final showdown in Moscow where Carlos is killed, allowing Bourne to finally abandon espionage and reclaim his identity as a husband and father.

## User’s Original Summary  
The Bourne Ultimatum  

Jason Bourne (real name David Webb) is living quietly with his wife Marie and their children when his old nemesis, Carlos the Jackal, resurfaces. Carlos is aging and losing influence, but obsessed with killing Bourne before his own career ends.  

Carlos begins striking out with attacks on Bourne’s friends and allies to draw him into the open. Bourne knows he can’t ignore it — Carlos won’t stop until one of them is dead.  

Bourne reluctantly reactivates his Jason Bourne persona. With help from his old CIA contacts (including Conklin and Panov), he sets traps, deciphers coded messages, and fends off assassination attempts across Washington, New York, Paris, and Moscow.  

Marie and the children are constantly under threat. Bourne goes to extreme lengths to protect them, even faking their capture at one point to mislead Carlos.  

Meanwhile, Carlos gathers his own network of assassins and corrupt officials. He tries to manipulate governments and intelligence agencies into turning against Bourne. Still, Bourne always stays one step ahead.  

The tension builds to a showdown in Moscow, where Carlos is cornered. The Jackal, desperate and declining, refuses to give up. In the final confrontation, Carlos is killed, ending the decades-long rivalry.  

With his enemy gone, Bourne is finally free to step away from the world of espionage. He chooses his real identity — David Webb — and returns to his family, determined to live as a husband and father instead of a weapon.
