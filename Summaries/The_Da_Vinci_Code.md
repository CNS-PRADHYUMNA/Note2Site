## User’s Original Summary  
The Da Vinci Code  

The story begins in Paris, where the curator of the Louvre, Jacques Saunière, is found murdered. Before dying, he leaves a series of cryptic clues for his granddaughter and others to find.  

Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, is called in to help interpret these clues. He teams up with Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist and Saunière’s granddaughter. Together, they follow a trail of puzzles, riddles, and secret messages hidden in famous artworks, including Leonardo da Vinci’s paintings.  

As they investigate, they discover that Saunière was part of a secret society called the Priory of Sion, which has been protecting a monumental secret for centuries: the truth about the Holy Grail. Contrary to legend, the Grail is not a cup, but Mary Magdalene, who carried Jesus’ bloodline.  

Langdon and Sophie must evade police suspicion and a deadly albino monk named Silas, who works for Opus Dei, a secretive Catholic organization determined to suppress the Grail’s secret. Along the way, they travel across France and England, uncover hidden messages in cathedrals, Rosicrucian texts, and Da Vinci’s artwork.  

Through dangerous twists and betrayals, they learn that the Grail secret has been hidden in plain sight and that the key is solving puzzles, including the famous Fibonacci sequence and cryptic anagrams.  

Finally, they discover that Sophie herself is descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, making her a living link to the bloodline. The Priory of Sion has been protecting her identity for centuries. Silas dies, and the mystery is resolved — the Grail secret survives, hidden, but known to those who are worthy.  

Langdon leaves with a deeper understanding of history, art, and religion, while Sophie embraces her heritage and the responsibilities it brings.
